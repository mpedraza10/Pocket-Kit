# Pocket-Kit
High School Project iOS Application that covers most health aspects in order to encourage people to have a healthy life. 

This was a team final school project in which I was in charge of programming the app, in this I tried to use more advanced features using a menu, map to get location,
different sections and a more personal touch making it an all in one convenient app where you can also have your emergency call and hospitals near you and cover 
all sorts of emergencies from first aid techniques, diseases, and encouraging a healthy lifestyle.
